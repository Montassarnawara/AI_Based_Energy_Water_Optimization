About Dataset
This dataset simulates real-world smart farming operations powered by IoT sensors and satellite data. It captures environmental and operational variables that affect crop yield across 500 farms located in regions like India, the USA, and Africa.

Designed to reflect modern agritech systems, the data is ideal for:

Predictive modeling using ML/AI
Time-series analysis
Sensor-based optimization
Environmental data visualizations
Crop health analytics
🧠 Ideal For
Supervised ML models (regression, classification)
Yield prediction and optimization
Agricultural decision support systems
Smart irrigation strategy analysis
Data visualization of regional farm efficiency
